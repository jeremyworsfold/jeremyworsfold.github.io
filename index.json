This is just a test. It\u0026rsquo;s really slow. The compressed html is 73MB for LSOA London and 123MB for MSOA e0 in England. This is with super-generalised shapefiles too, never mind if we want to get things at 20m resolution for LSOAs. Other annoying things:\n kepler.gl is slow MSOA England level takes even longer to load It is slow It flashes between frames sometimes because it uses a rolling window to animate rather than a point for each year The year comes up with minutes and seconds and milliseconds and picoseconds The file sizes are too big to put on github without lfs  I probably need to find a more practical solution for the full result.\nHave a play. Show the legend at the side. I would like to make this full screen too.\n","date":1604696512,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604696512,"objectID":"fe859c6266641600992fd6a0d6f11947","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/post/post1/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T21:01:52Z","relpermalink":"/post/post1/","section":"post","summary":"Provisional results.
