This is by no means exhaustive and there is much more information on the wiki page. In fact, much of the information on Balena here is just condensed from that website. The rest of this guide is general tips on how to transfer files and navigate the environment.\nLogging onto Balena Purely from a terminal If you are on campus you can skip the first step and ssh directly into balena. Otherwise open a terminal and type\nssh user123@linux.bath.ac.uk\r This opens up a link to the uni server (ssh stands for secure shell). Put in your password and then do the same again but change linux to balena:\nssh user123@balena.bath.ac.uk\r Great, you are now in your personal home directory on balena.\nKitty Using the image below taken from the wiki page should be sufficient in explaining how to login using Kitty.\nTransferring data or files Since you are running your code on balena, you will at some point have to move around data using a terminal so I would recommend doing this for all the steps. The added benefit of this is that your commands are stored so you can always just reuse your previous commands using the up arrows if you can\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly what a command should be.\nTo move files between your PC and balena you will sadly have to go through your uni drive unless you are on campus.\nFrom H drive to balena You can simply copy files across using linux cp commands and the fact that your H drive is called $BUCSHOME on balena. For example, run the command\ncp -r folder/with/data $BUCSHOME/destination/folder\r to copy a folder with data from balena to your H drive.\nFrom local PC to H drive You can transfer data to and from University personal drive from your PC by using scp which stands for secure copy and essentially opens up a ssh portal and then closes it again once the files are transferred.\nSending files Type one of these from within a terminal/kitty/putty on your PC:\nscp path/to/directory/f.txt user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/directory/\rscp -r path/to/directory/ user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/directory/\r The first will transfer the file file.txt whereas the second will transfer the whole directory.\nRetrieving files This is the same as above but with the directories reversed in order, for example:\nscp user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/remote/directory/file.txt path/to/local/directory/\r Alternatively if you want, you can use something more familiar which is visual. For linux this would be mounting your Uni drive to your PC using a command called sshfs. For Windows you can download an application called WinSCP which looks like it hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed since 2005 and basically hasn\u0026rsquo;t but it\u0026rsquo;s neat and very useful if that\u0026rsquo;s your thing. A quick google of either of these should give you the information you need. Finally you can use a browser to do this instead if you would like, see here for more details.\nWhere do I store my files? So, I will be the first to admit that I have ran long jobs from my $HOME directory. This is bad. It will work but it is faster and better apparently to run your jobs in the $SCRATCH. It\u0026rsquo;ll be tedious at first but getting used to using simple commands like cp and \\verb!ls! will be really helpful. Make sure to save all of your results rather than just plotting graphs at the end, you never know when you might want to alter figures and need the original data again. I would recommend just saving your data and maybe copying it back to your PC to visualise the results. See my guide on how to layout and use a python package for a small research project for more detailed recommendations on how to handle results and plotting for Python specifically.\nJobscripts The thing you run is the jobscript using the command\nsbatch \u0026lt;name of jobscript\u0026gt;.slm\r Below I\u0026rsquo;ve put in an example jobscript that has been adapted from the one given in the scientific computing module. Make sure you are in the directory of the jobscript when you call it and that the program you want to run is in the same folder or that you have specified where it is in the jobscript. \\lstinputlisting{slurm.txt} The important bits to check are the job name and the time. For ease I have just made the job name the same as the name of the script you want to run. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain later what the job name is actually used for. Balena allows you free, unlimited usage for jobs which are under 6 hours long so make sure you know approximately how long it will take and change the time given accordingly. Nothing will happen if you overestimate how long you need but it could be helpful for other users to know when their jobs will start if balena is busy and puts your job in ahead of theirs.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using MATLAB and the paralellisation package thing that I know nothing about, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to change the number of tasks per node to the maximum of 16 I imagine. Otherwise, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve done clever things with the MPI4pi or multiprocessing packages in python (which I would highly recommend you learn about if you need to run long programs a lot because this could increase your speed by 16 times or more) then you will probably just be using the one processor and so don\u0026rsquo;t need to change anything.\nChecking Jobs You will get an output file with the extension .out telling you everything that happens in the job that would normally printed to the screen if you ran it from a terminal.\nTo check your progress or see if the job has started you can find your jobs by typing\nsqueue -u user123\r ","date":1608543892,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608543892,"objectID":"bfaf2f2779508d6f725d21d9fa6d0ce1","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/post/balenaguide/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T09:44:52Z","relpermalink":"/post/balenaguide/","section":"post","summary":"This informal guide is for people new to using Balena and effectively want to take code they have written to run on their laptop in something like Python or MATLAB and now run it on Balena.","tags":["Scientific Computing","how-to guide"],"title":"A Beginners Guide to using Balena","type":"post"},{"authors":["Shahzeb Raja Noureen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607595300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607595300,"objectID":"8ebd419eea8ff22b0cd844395c4e443f","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/shahzeb/","publishdate":"2020-12-10T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/shahzeb/","section":"pss","summary":"Investigating the formation of hair follicles","tags":["Mathematical Biology"],"title":"Modelling hair follicle development and formation of periodic patterns of cells.","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yi Shen Lim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606990500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606990500,"objectID":"e78c15154b7b241aff9a9993a296ca33","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/yisheng/","publishdate":"2020-12-03T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/yisheng/","section":"pss","summary":"Probability is a big subject. My goal for the session will be to give a tour of what kind of maths happens at its core. The basic objects are probability spaces and random variables, which are built on the language of measure theory. My take, however, is that measure theory is just half of the story -- you do not want to do probability on *any* space ... it must be on a space as nice as R. In other words, I would say that the core of probability is about *Probability Measures on Metric Spaces*. This is the title of a book by K R Parthasarathy.\nSo, the tour centres around this book. I will take some time to explain how one should go from A-Level probability and statistics + mathematical analysis (point set topology, metric spaces) to the starting point of this book. Once we have reached the start of the book, I will give a whirlwind tour on the most important ideas in it. The second part is intended to be a touch-and-go, as a cultural appreciation of the language and the results that one can expect in this field.

For example in ecosystems, we know that the extinction of a prey species can lead to a mass extinction of predator species that feed on prey to sustain themselves, and genetic diversity helps organisms adapting to changing environments and rapidly evolving diseases. But is there a way to quantify stability with maths?\nWhen mathematicians speak about the stability of ecosystems, they usually refer to the asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point, characterised by the eigenvalues of a species interaction matrix. In reality, however, these interaction coefficients are difficult - if not impossible - to measure. Therefore in 1972, Robert M. May introduced a community matrix model, where coefficients are sampled from a random distribution, and derived a stability criterion based on the distribution of the eigenvalues using random matrix theory. For nearly 50 years, this model has been improved and applied in theoretical ecology.","tags":["Ecology","complex systems"],"title":"Will a Large Complex System be Stable?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Matt Turner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605780900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605780900,"objectID":"a58742def960e898f19a55da9571b684","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/mattturner/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/mattturner/","section":"pss","summary":"It is rare that blowing something up solves a problem - but when it comes to objects with singularities, it turns out to be a good approach!
