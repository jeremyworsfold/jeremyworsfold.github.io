We will see how this distance can be applied to optimal stopping problems, and if there's time we'll discuss extending it to cover continuous-time processes like Brownian motion.\nThis is the topic that I'm starting to work on in my postdoc.

My goal for the session will be to give a tour of what kind of maths happens at its core. The basic objects are probability spaces and random variables, which are built on the language of measure theory. My take, however, is that measure theory is just half of the story -- you do not want to do probability on *any* space ... it must be on a space as nice as R. In other words, I would say that the core of probability is about *Probability Measures on Metric Spaces*. This is the title of a book by K R Parthasarathy.\nSo, the tour centres around this book. I will take some time to explain how one should go from A-Level probability and statistics + mathematical analysis (point set topology, metric spaces) to the starting point of this book. Once we have reached the start of the book, I will give a whirlwind tour on the most important ideas in it. The second part is intended to be a touch-and-go, as a cultural appreciation of the language and the results that one can expect in this field.

For example in ecosystems, we know that the extinction of a prey species can lead to a mass extinction of predator species that feed on prey to sustain themselves, and genetic diversity helps organisms adapting to changing environments and rapidly evolving diseases. But is there a way to quantify stability with maths?\nWhen mathematicians speak about the stability of ecosystems, they usually refer to the asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point, characterised by the eigenvalues of a species interaction matrix. In reality, however, these interaction coefficients are difficult - if not impossible - to measure. Therefore in 1972, Robert M. May introduced a community matrix model, where coefficients are sampled from a random distribution, and derived a stability criterion based on the distribution of the eigenvalues using random matrix theory. For nearly 50 years, this model has been improved and applied in theoretical ecology.","tags":["Ecology","complex systems"],"title":"Will a Large Complex System be Stable?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Matt Turner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605780900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605780900,"objectID":"a58742def960e898f19a55da9571b684","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/mattturner/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/mattturner/","section":"pss","summary":"It is rare that blowing something up solves a problem - but when it comes to objects with singularities, it turns out to be a good approach! In this talk, I will outline the method of blowing up a singularity of an algebraic variety in order to produce a new variety. This new geometrical object will have very similar properties, but with the added benefit of being less singular, or even smooth.\nAlong the way, I will introduce the notion of projective space and how embedded objects can be seen using charts.
