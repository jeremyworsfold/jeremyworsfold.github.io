Instead just draw points for each iteration and maybe connect them up.\nFor parts (d) and (e) in particular, be careful about the initial condition of your \u0026lsquo;cobweb\u0026rsquo;. In all cases $x_0=1$ but I saw many people either not consider where it should be on the line or incorrectly figure out the y and x intercepts. In both cases it didn\u0026rsquo;t change the end result but it is still important and could definitely change the outcome in a nonlinear map. Below are how parts (d) and (e) were meant to look.\nQuestion 3 a) $$ x^* = \\frac{rx^*}{1+x^*} $$ $$ \\Rightarrow x^*=0,\\quad \\text{or } \\quad x^*=r-1 $$\n Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to point out that the second steady state only exists if $r\u0026gt;1$ otherwise it would suggest $x\u0026lt;0$ which is unphysical for a population model.   b) Mostly fine but just remember to state what the stability of the steady states are.\nc) Some of you were uncertain on how to do the final part of this question. There were two ways to do this, the lazy way (total valid) and the hard way (without using results from the notes).\nEither way we start with $$ \\begin{aligned} y_n \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{x_n} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{y_{n+1}} \u0026amp; = \\frac{r/y_n}{(y_n+1)/y_n} \\\\\n\u0026amp; = \\frac{r}{y_n+1} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow y_{n+1} \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{r}y_n + \\frac{1}{r}. \\end{aligned} $$ So at this point we could just peak at the notes and remember that, for a linear map of the form $x_{n+1} = \\lambda x_n + \\mu$, the general solution is $$ x_n = x_0 \\lambda^n + \\frac{\\mu}{1-\\lambda}(1-\\lambda^n). $$ Realising that we have a linear map in $y_n$ we can plugging in what we have we\u0026rsquo;d get $$ \\begin{aligned} y_n \u0026amp; = y_0\\frac{1}{r^n} + \\frac{1/r}{1-1/r}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{r^n}\\right) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow y_n \u0026amp; = \\frac{y_0(r-1)+r^n-1}{r^n(r-1)} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow x_n \u0026amp; = \\frac{r^n(r-1)}{\\frac{1}{x_0}(r-1)+r^n-1} \\\\\n\\end{aligned} $$ If we didn\u0026rsquo;t want to copy the result from the lectures we could find it ourself and do it the hard way. I won\u0026rsquo;t put that in here (because I can\u0026rsquo;t be bothered to type it out) but it\u0026rsquo;s in the solutions to the problem sheets, it\u0026rsquo;s in the tutorial whiteboard notes at the top of this page and it\u0026rsquo;s very similar to what is in the lecture notes.\nLecture Content The book keeping method In general, for a system we can keep track of the amount of stuff over time. We basically say that the total change of stuff in a region is:\n $+$ stuff created $-$ stuff destroyed $+$ stuff in $-$ stuff out  Here\u0026rsquo;s my attempt to summarise this in a diagram. We have some quantity $x$ in a box $R$ at time $t_0$ then the second box is the stuff in the box at time $t$.\nProblem sheet B1 Question 1 We assume no radioactive nuclei are created (and that no particles enter or leave the system). So the only way the number of particles can change is from nuclear decay: $$ N(t) = N(t_0) - \\text{number of particles decayed}. $$ We are told the number of disintegrations is proportional to the total number of particles. Thus, $$ \\Rightarrow N(t) = N(t_0) - \\lambda \\int_0^t N(s)\\mathrm{d}s. $$ Using the fundamental theorem of calculus we can differentiate and get $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}t} \u0026amp; = \\lambda N \\\\\n\\Rightarrow N(t) \u0026amp; = N(t_0)e^{-\\lambda t}. \\end{aligned} $$\nWe know that:\n Rate is 22 decays per min at $t_0$ Rate is 8.5 decays per min at $t_F$  Also we can find $\\lambda$ by using the half-life, $\\tau=22.3$ years: $$ \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{2} = e^{-\\tau\\lambda} \\Rightarrow \\lambda=\\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\tau}. $$\n This is quite a useful relationship to remember by the way. $$\\lambda=\\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\tau}$$   We want to know $t_F-t_0$ so let\u0026rsquo;s look at the ratio of the decay rates at these two times $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\lambda N(t_F)}{\\lambda N(t_0)} \u0026amp; = e^{-\\lambda(t_F-t_0)} = \\frac{8.5}{22} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\lambda(t_F-t_0) \u0026amp; = \\ln\\left(\\frac{22}{8.5}\\right) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow t_F-t_0 \u0026amp; = \\frac{\\tau}{\\ln(2)}\\ln\\left(\\frac{22}{8.5}\\right) \\approx 30.59\\\\\n\\end{aligned} $$ The final time $t_F$ was 1967AD so $t_0\\approx$1936AD so it could be an early Vermeer.\nQuestion 4 a) We know that enerrgy is conserved so the thermal energy the ice has at $t$ is what it started with at $t_0$ plus the amount of energy used to change the mass of ice from $m(t_0)$ to $m(t)$. $$ \\begin{aligned} Q(t) \u0026amp; = Q(t_0) + L(m(t_0)-m(t)) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t} \u0026amp; = - L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}m}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\end{aligned} $$\nb) Thermal energy of ice at time $t$ = thermal energy of ice at time $t_0$ + energy absorbed in that time. Newton\u0026rsquo;s Law of cooling says that the rate of absorption of energy is proportional to the area of the body and the difference between their temperatures. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\Rightarrow Q(t) \u0026amp; = Q(t_0) + \\int_{t_0}^t KA(t)(\\theta_1-\\theta_0)\\mathrm{d}s \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t} \u0026amp; = KA(t)(\\theta_1-\\theta_0) \\\\\n\\end{aligned} $$\nc) Equate the two relationships for the rate of change of thermal energy so that $$ L\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m}{\\mathrm{d}t} = KA(t)(\\theta_1-\\theta_0) $$ Now for a sphere with radius $r$:\n volume: V = $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ surface area: A = $4\\pi r^2$ So the total mass at time $t$ is $$ m(t) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\rho r^3(t) $$ where $\\rho$ is the density. Therefore, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}m}{\\mathrm{d}t} \u0026amp; = 4\\pi\\rho r^2(t) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 4\\pi L \\rho r^2 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}t} \u0026amp; = 4\\pi r^2 K(\\theta_1-\\theta_0) \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{\\mathrm{d}t} \u0026amp; = \\frac{K}{L\\rho}(\\theta_0-\\theta_1) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow r(t) \u0026amp; = \\frac{K}{L\\rho}(\\theta_0-\\theta_1)t + r_0 \\end{aligned} $$ We finally have an equation for the radius at time $t$ for the ball of ice and the time, $T$, at which it has completely melted should be when $r(T)=0$ $$ \\Rightarrow T = \\frac{r_0L\\rho}{K(\\theta_1-\\theta_0)}. $$  ","date":1648206900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648206900,"objectID":"93577ef6938244f721ed808ece5d5766","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/tutoring/week7/","publishdate":"2022-03-25T11:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutoring/week7/","section":"tutoring","summary":"Book Keeping Method","tags":["dynamical systems"],"title":"Week 7: 25/03/22","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jeremy Worsfold"],"categories":null,"content":"Table of Contents  Comments on Problem sheet A4  Question 1 Question 3   Lecture Content  First order maps Linear Maps Cobweb Diagrams Bifurcations: logistic map     Comments on Problem sheet A4 It\u0026rsquo;s really important that you remember to check the allowed values for the parameters and state variables! This caused some problems in both questions.\nQuestion 1 We were asked to find the condition where it goes from a node to a focus. Recall from week 4 we said, for a 2D system with $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{x}}=A\\boldsymbol{x}$ and defining $det(A)=\\gamma$ and $tr(A)=\\beta$, the eigenvalues are $$ \\lambda_i = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\beta\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta^2-4\\gamma}\\right). $$ A focus has complex eigenvalues while a node has real eigenvalues so our boundary where we go from one to the other is $$ \\beta^2=4\\gamma. $$ Which leads us to the condition $$ \\mu=\\frac{4\\alpha^2}{4\\alpha+1}. $$ However, remember that $x\u0026gt;0,y\u0026gt;0$ always so the steady state $(x^*,y^*)=(\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha},1-\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha})$ only exists when $\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}\u0026lt;1$ and $\\mu\u0026gt;0,\\alpha\u0026gt;0$ so you need to be careful with the diagram.\nQuestion 3 This question was mainly testing the idea of nullclines so the general approach was to first set $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{dx}{dt} \u0026amp; = 0 \\Rightarrow x=0 \\text{ or } c=\\frac{1}{a} \\\\\n\\frac{dc}{dt} \u0026amp; = 0 \\Rightarrow c=\\frac{c_0}{1+ax} \\end{aligned} $$ which gives us the nullclines in each direction. The steady states are thus where these lines cross: $$ (x^*,c^*) = (0,c_0) \\text{ or } (c_0-\\frac{1}{a},\\frac{1}{a}). $$\n But the second steady state only exists if $c_0\u0026gt;\\frac{1}{a}$ because $x\u0026gt;0$.   Then we can look at the stability of these steady states by finding the Jacobian and evaluating it at the steady states for the two cases\n i) $1\u0026lt;ac_0$: we find that $(0,c_0)$ is an unstable saddle node and $(c_0-\\frac{1}{a},\\frac{1}{a})$ is a stable node (can just check Routh-Hurwitz) ii) $1\u0026gt;ac_0$: we find that $(0,c_0)$ is stable and the other does not exist.  Even without looking at the stability we could draw the nullclines and basically answer the question but the stability helps attempt to sketch the trajectories. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to look at the first case and think the non-trivial steady state is a spiral node but it is in fact this weird looking stable node.\n i)  ii)   Lecture Content First order maps A first order map (with one parameter $\\mu$) can generally be written as $$ x_{n+1} = f(x_n;\\mu) $$\n We\u0026rsquo;ll use this to model things like populations but notice this applies to other things like Newton\u0026rsquo;s method for finding roots of a function g: $$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{g(x_n)}{g'(x_n)} $$ where we essentially are just iteratively getting better approximations of the steady state where $g(x^*)=0$, which is the root we are trying to find.   Again we have steady states, $x^*$, where $$ f(x^*;\\mu) = x^* $$ and we can do linear stability analysis on it like before about the steady state: $$ \\begin{aligned} x_n \u0026amp; = x^* + y_n, \\quad |y_N|\\ll 1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow y_{n+1} = f'(x^*)y_n. \\end{aligned} $$ To understand this we need to know how linear maps behave.\nLinear Maps Linear maps look like this: $$ x_{n+1} = \\lambda x_n + \\mu $$ which we can obtain a full solution for (see the main notes for details) $$ x_n = x_0\\lambda^n + \\frac{\\mu}{1-\\lambda}(1-\\lambda^n). $$ Also we can find the steady state: $$ \\begin{aligned} x^* \u0026amp; = \\lambda x^* + \\mu \\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^* \u0026amp; = \\frac{\\mu}{1-\\lambda} \\end{aligned} $$ This gives us four types of behaviour:\n $\\lambda\u0026gt;1$: $|x_n|\\rightarrow\\infty$ and $x_n$ is monotonic as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ $\\lambda\u0026lt;-1$: $|x_n|\\rightarrow\\infty$ and $x_n$ oscillates as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ $0\u0026lt;\\lambda\u0026lt;1$: $|x_n|\\rightarrow x^*$ and $x_n$ is monotonic as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ $-1\u0026lt;\\lambda\u0026lt;0$: $|x_n|\\rightarrow x^*$ and $x_n$ oscillates as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$  This behaviour can then be applied to the linearised non-linear maps about the steady states to analyse the stability of the steady states.\nCobweb Diagrams The general approach to this geometric method is as follows:\n Start with the line $x_{n+1} = x_n$ Next, plot the function $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ Starting from the $x_n$ axis at $x_0$, draw vertically to the point $f(x_0)$ Draw horizontally from $f(x_0)$ to $x_1=f(x_0)$ (the $x_{n+1}=x_n$ line). Then draw a line vertically from there to $f(x_1)$. Continue this until you reach a steady state or it appears to go off to infinity.  Below is an illustration for some arbitrary example\nBifurcations: logistic map In the lectures you were given an example of the Ricker map, but here I\u0026rsquo;ll mention a similar model called the logistic map. This is defined as $$ x_{n+1} = \\mu x_n(1-x_n) $$ This is a really famous example and there\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic numberphile video on it which I\u0026rsquo;d encourage you to watch if you\u0026rsquo;re interested and have a go at mapping yourself.

For a lot of the solutions I got I put \u0026ldquo;what about $\\mu=0$?\u0026rdquo; This might seem like a minor detail but if you put $\\mu\u0026gt;0$ and $\\mu\u0026lt;0$ for your conditions then you should state separately what happens for $\\mu=0$. Also, reason you should look at this case is because, for $\\mu=0$, $x^*=0$ and $f'(0)=0$. This means that it is a non-hyperbolic steady state so we actually can\u0026rsquo;t tell from the linear stability analysis whether it is stable or unstable. This is as far as you are expected to go although the written solutions do go into more detail if you are interested.\nQuestion 4 In my opinion, the easiest way to do part (a) was to leave everything in terms of $x,y$ until the end. Again I won\u0026rsquo;t put in the details here since they are in the written solutions if you want to see them. Anyway, we end up finding that $\\kappa=\\mu-\\lambda$.\nThe steady states of this are then $p^*=0,1$. From here we can use our linear stability analysis: $$ \\frac{df}{dp} = \\kappa(1-2p) $$ and substitute in our steady states for both $\\kappa\u0026gt;0$ and $\\kappa\u0026lt;0$.\nAt this point I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to look back at the question and think about what is going on in the system and what the question is really asking. The thing I wanted you to say once you\u0026rsquo;d found the stability of these points was that if:\n $\\kappa\u0026gt;0$: $\\mu\u0026gt;\\lambda$, so species $x$ grows exponentially faster than $y$ and eventually dominates as $p\\rightarrow 1$ as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$ (as long as $p_0\\neq 0$). $\\kappa\u0026lt;0$: $\\mu\u0026lt;\\lambda$, so species $y$ grows exponentially faster than $x$ and eventually dominates as $p\\rightarrow 0$ as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$ (as long as $p_0\\neq 1$).  Finally, many of you said that for $\\kappa=0$, the steady states $p^*=0,1$ are non-hyperbolic so nothing can be said. This is kind of true but also not. Yes the linear stability tells us $f'(p^*)=0$ but we can still say things about the system without using linear stability.\n$$ \\kappa=0 \\Rightarrow f(p) = 0, \\quad \\forall p $$ This means that $p=p^*, \\forall p$ (all values of p are steady states). This means that the proportion of bacteria species stays the same no matter the initial condition. Now, this makes sense since $\\kappa=0$ implies $\\mu=\\lambda$ sp they grow at the same rate. Again this is as far as you were expected to go but I added an extra question if you got this far asking what this means for the stability of these steady states.\nLook back at the definitions of stability and asymptotic stability. The colloquial interpretations of these terms were\n Stable: starts near, stays near. Asymptotically stable: starts near, tends to eventually.  Which of these apply to the case where $\\kappa=0$? Well if we start at $p_0$ we stay there and if we start at $p_0+\\varepsilon$ where $\\varepsilon$ is a small positive constant we stay at $p_0+\\varepsilon$ too. We can see, therefore, that $p_0$ is stable but is not asymptotically stable because trajectories near it never actually move towards it. I think this is a good example of how the two definitions are distinct even though in many of the situations we see, the stable points are also asymptotically stable and vice-versa.\n Outline of lecture content The main concept introduced last week was expanding what we\u0026rsquo;ve done to linear systems of ODEs. You spent a lot of time last semester solving these kinds of systems but now, just like with the 1D systems we\u0026rsquo;ve studied, we want to quickly understand the behaviour of the system quickly without solving it explicitly.\nThe notes go through the different situations we can have for 2D linear systems and below I\u0026rsquo;ve put a diagram of all of these situations. As in the notes we have $$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = A\\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2, A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2\\times2} $$ and we denote $\\mathrm{Tr}(A)=\\gamma$, $\\mathrm{det}(A)=\\beta$\nExample diagrams of these situations can be found in the notes but I have most of them in the notes linked at the top of this page. Also Below I\u0026rsquo;ve put a video of how these phases go from one type of node to the other. On the left is an example of what the trajectories might look like for the $\\gamma,\\beta$ values shown in the figure on the right.\n  Problem sheet A3 Question 1   (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./a3q1.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-864259371', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  Question 2  Use the chain rule: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{dR}{dt} \u0026amp; = \\frac{dR}{dx}\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{dR}{dy}\\frac{dy}{dt} \\\\\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \u0026amp; = \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{d\\theta}{dy}\\frac{dy}{dt}. \\end{aligned} $$ It may be pretty fiddly getting the bottom line answer but both $R(t)$ and $\\theta(t)$ should be simple expressions by the end\u0026hellip;   Question 3   (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./a3q3.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-348261597', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  Question 4   (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./a3q4.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-732964581', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  ","date":1646352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646352000,"objectID":"6853a8ddc2f8370692fb2ffaf008b7ab","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/tutoring/week4/","publishdate":"2022-03-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutoring/week4/","section":"tutoring","summary":"Linear Systems of ODEs","tags":["odes"],"title":"Week 4: 23/02/22","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jeremy Worsfold"],"categories":null,"content":"Table of Contents  Comments on Problem sheet A1  Question 2 Question 3   Outline of lecture content  Geometric Method Linear Stability Analysis Bifurcations   Problem sheet A2  Question 1 Question 3     Comments on Problem sheet A1  One thing to mention is that all of the questions we will answer are rooted in some real life problem which we want to model. Therefore, when you give numerical answers, it\u0026rsquo;s important to give the units and probably also to how many significant figures.   Question 2 I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything in particular to highlight for this question.\nQuestion 3   b) The key point here is that we are told the concentration is at a steady state so $dV/dt = f(V) = 0$. We know $\\mu$ from the previous part of the question so we can sub in our values for $V,\\mu$ into $$ \\kappa=\\mu V $$\n  c) first solve for $I(t)$ then sub into $V(t)$ ode which can then be solved. Again, easiest in this case to use integrating factor. The written solutions go into a lot of detail by looking at $\\mu\u0026gt;\\delta$ and $\\mu\u0026lt;\\delta$ then $\\mu\\rightarrow\\delta$ to show that $V$ is always positive. The key things to look at when we want to sketch the solution and then comment on it are:\n Is $V$ always positive? (as the solutions show) What does it look like near $t\\approx0$? ($dV/dt\u0026gt;0$ so is increasing) What does it look like as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$? ($V\\rightarrow 0$) Are there any turning points?  We can infer that there is a turning point purely from the fact that $V$ starts off increasing from $0$ but will eventually return to $0$ so there must be a turning point which we can find explicity if needed. This gives us enough information to draw a sketch of the solution though which can be seen below for some arbitrary choice of $\\delta,\\mu$.\n    (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./a1q3.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-476832591', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();   Outline of lecture content Geometric Method This picture should sum up the takeaways from this section in the notes. If $f(x)\u0026gt;0$ then $x$ by definition is increasing and so our system will move towards the right. Conversely if $f(x)\u0026lt;0$ then $x$ decreases and so we draw a left arrow instead. This then tells us the stability of our steady states located at $f(x)=0$. If the arrows point inwards then it\u0026rsquo;s stable and we can show this with a filled circle, if they point outwards then it\u0026rsquo;s unstable and we denote this with a hollow circle.\n What happens if there is a turning point at $f(x)=0$? Is the steady state stable or unstable?   Linear Stability Analysis There isn\u0026rsquo;t much to add here beyond what the lecture notes have.\nBifurcations Now we have non-linear systems with some parameter $\\mu$ and we want to know how the system behaves for different values of this parameter. We can still use the same techniques as before but now we get a rich understanding of a more general problem.\n Firstly, we can find the steady states, $x^*$, such that $f(x^*;\\mu)=0$. This will give us some solutions for $x^*$ in terms of our parameter $\\mu$. Next we need to make sure we know for what values of $\\mu$, these solutions exist. When there is a range of values for which some solutions exist but do not outside this range, we get a bifurcation. We can then go ahead and plot these solutions in the allowed range in a plot of $x$ vs $\\mu$. Finally, to determine the stability of these solutions, we use the linear stability method from before. If a solution is stable then $$ \\frac{dx}{dt}|_{x^*}\u0026lt;0 $$ and the opposite is true for unstable solutions. If we have equality then the steady state is non-hyperbolic and we have to look at the higher derivaties. We then draw the unstable solutions with dashed lines and the stable ones with filled in lines  In the notes which are available at the top of this page, I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn a few examples of some bifurcations we might see. Some are a bit beyond what will be studied in the course but this gives an idea of the standard types of sketches we expect to see. Below is one such example.\n Notice that in all cases, in the $x$-direction the solutions for $x^*$ will alternate between being stable and unstable. If this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case then this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make sense as arrows would be pointing in contradicting directions and the only resolution to this would be for another steady state to exist of the opposite type in between these solutions. Specifically, $f(x)$ will have changed sign at some point between the solutions and so $f(x)=0$ at some point.    Problem sheet A2 Question 1 This question does not really have anything conceptually new. The steps are just\n Use the substitution specified Use an integrating factor of $\\exp(\\int P(t) dt)$ Obtain a solution for $y$ in terms of general $P(t),Q(t)$. Substitute in $P(t)=-r$, $Q(t)=-r/k$ and $n=2$. The rest is rearranging for $x(t)$ and putting in an initial condition of $x(0)=x_0$. Full working can be found in the solutions on moodle.  Question 3 Following the steps I outlined before we first find that $$ x_{\\pm}^* = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4\\mu}\\right) $$ Remember we need to check the range in which these solutions are valid. $$\\Rightarrow 4\\mu\\leq 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\mu\\leq\\frac{1}{4}$$ Also we\u0026rsquo;re working with a population and a harvesting rate so $x\u0026gt;0,\\mu\u0026gt;0$.\nNext we find the stability of these steady states: $$ \\frac{df}{dx} = 1 - 2x, \\quad \\Rightarrow \\frac{dx}{dt}|_ {x^*_{\\pm}} = \\mp\\sqrt{1-4\\mu} $$ so $x_{+}^*$ is stable and $x_{-}^*$ is unstable.\nWe can also check what happens when $\\mu\\geq1/4$. There is a turning point at $x=1/2$, and we know it\u0026rsquo;s maximum since $$ \\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = -2 $$ Now, $$f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)= \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}-\\mu=\\frac{1}{4}-\\mu\u0026lt;0$$. Therefore $f(x;\\mu)\u0026lt;0$ for $\\mu\u0026gt;1/4$ and thus the population goes to $0$.\nBelow I\u0026rsquo;ve put a heatmap of $f(x;\\mu)$, the boundary where it switches from light red to light blue gives us the steady state solutions and we can determine the stability too. Red means $f(x;\\mu)\u0026lt;0$ so it\u0026rsquo;s like an arrow pointing down while blue is like an arrow pointing up.\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./bifn.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-721896453', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  ","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645660800,"objectID":"6fd90e98dbcf1e49f96e75a7dfdcacb4","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/tutoring/week3/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutoring/week3/","section":"tutoring","summary":"Nonlinear 1D Systems","tags":["odes"],"title":"Week 3: 16/02/22","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jeremy Worsfold"],"categories":null,"content":"Table of Contents  Outline of lecture content  What makes a well posed problem?

Problem sheet 1 The main point of most of this module is to test your abilities to turn a problem often in the form of a paragraph into a mathematical model which you then solve and then learn something about the behaviour of the system or whatever from the solution. Because of this I will not just give you the start of the problem because that is often half of the difficulty in the question. Learning how to do this quickly and effectively now will help you a lot later down the road, so do keep trying even if you feel stuck.\nQuestion 1  One question you might ask about this problem is why does the dead plant matter have a decreasing number of radioactive carbon atoms but the carbon in the atmosphere does not? This is a bit of a side note but essentially Carbon-14 is produced when particles in the upper atmosphere and troposphere collide with cosmic particles and all sorts of interesting physics happens. These interactions sometimes produce neutrons which can then collide with the abundand nitrogen in the air to make Carbon-14 with the following interaction:\n147N + n → 146C + p\n  Anyway the point is that once the plant dies it is separated from this system of radioactive carbon being created and decaying so we just have the decay. From the lectures we saw that the general radioactive decay equation is $$\\dot{x}(t) = -\\lambda x(t)$$ which has the solution $$x(t) = x(0)e^{-\\lambda t} $$. The key is to figure out what this rate of decay $\\lambda$ is in terms of the half-life which we are given. The half-life is the time, $T_{1/2}$ for the amount of 14C to half so we can write that $$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp\\left[-\\lambda T_{1/2}\\right]$$ which rearranges to give $$ \\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}$$. From here, all we need to do is recognise that we want to find the time $T$ where the activity is $0.97$ and we know that initially the activity was $6.68$ so we have $$ 0.97 = 6.68 e^{-\\lambda T}$$. With some more rearranging we get the solution $$ T = \\frac{T_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)}\\ln\\left(6.68/0.97\\right) \\approx 1.5951 \\times 10^4 \\text{ years}$$\n Wondered why the radioactive decay is what it is? It may make intuitive sense to you or it may not. Either way a nice way to think about it is that the probability of a single atom decaying in time $t$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $\\lambda$. Over a period of time $t$ the probability that is has not decayed is $1-F(t)=1-e^{-\\lambda t}$, where $F(t)$ is the cumulative distribution. If all of the atoms can be treated as independent (and as long as the number of particles is large) then the expected number of particles left by time t is $\\langle N\\rangle = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$.\nOr we could say that rate of one atom decaying is $\\lambda$ so the rate of any of the $N$ particles decaying is $N\\lambda$ so this gives us an instantaneous rate of change of the system so $dN=-N\\lambda dt$.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure given some more thought, one of you could make this a bit more rigourous.\n  Question 2 Should be relatively straight forward\nQuestion 3  a) What do the two terms on the RHS mean physically? b) What does the steady state distribution mean for the ODE? c) This one is just a following through the maths so I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that up to you.  Question 4 This question is pretty straight forwards in terms of setting up the problem. All we need to do is solve the ODE in the case that $c_i=c_a=\\text{ constant}$ and substitute in the initial condition that the concentration starts at some value $c_0=c(0)$ so we can substitute this condition in for any constants of integration. Then we do the same for the second case.\nThe trick in part b is to notice that we can rewrite the ODE as $$ \\begin{aligned} c_b'(t) \u0026amp; = \\phi \\left( c_a \\left( \\lambda + \\phi \\alpha (1-\\lambda) t \\right)- c_b(t)\\right) \\\\\\\nc_b'(t) + \\phi c_b(t) \u0026amp; = \\phi\\left(c_a\\left(\\lambda+\\phi\\alpha(1-\\lambda)t\\right)\\right) \\\\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left\\{c_b(t)e^{\\phi t}\\right\\} \u0026amp; = e^{\\phi t}\\phi\\left(c_a\\left(\\lambda+\\phi\\alpha(1-\\lambda)t\\right)\\right) \\end{aligned} $$ where we\u0026rsquo;ve used an integrating factor. From here we can integrate both sides and use integration by parts for the $t\\exp[\\phi t]$ term.\n","date":1644405300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644405300,"objectID":"5b6d59068d0dbac465760c94d74cd3dd","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/tutoring/week2/","publishdate":"2022-02-09T11:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutoring/week2/","section":"tutoring","summary":"Definitions and First order ODEs","tags":["odes"],"title":"Week 2: 09/02/22","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yyanis Johnson-Llambias"],"categories":["epidemiology","science in politics"],"content":"","date":1621505700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621505700,"objectID":"92415c108dc368b5c4dcd448e5769325","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/yyanis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/yyanis/","section":"pss","summary":"I will talk about the work I have done over the past 3 months in the UK Government Office for Science, the department responsible for ensuring the UK Gov has access to the best and most up to date scientific advice during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

For example, run the command\ncp -r folder/with/data $BUCSHOME/destination/folder\r to copy a folder with data from balena to your H drive.\nFrom local PC to H drive You can transfer data to and from University personal drive from your PC by using scp which stands for secure copy and essentially opens up a ssh portal and then closes it again once the files are transferred.\nSending files Type one of these from within a terminal/kitty/putty on your PC:\nscp path/to/directory/f.txt user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/directory/\rscp -r path/to/directory/ user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/directory/\r The first will transfer the file file.txt whereas the second will transfer the whole directory.\nRetrieving files This is the same as above but with the directories reversed in order, for example:\nscp user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/remote/directory/file.txt path/to/local/directory/\r Alternatively if you want, you can use something more familiar which is visual. For linux this would be mounting your Uni drive to your PC using a command called sshfs. For Windows you can download an application called WinSCP which looks like it hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed since 2005 and basically hasn\u0026rsquo;t but it\u0026rsquo;s neat and very useful if that\u0026rsquo;s your thing. A quick google of either of these should give you the information you need. Finally you can use a browser to do this instead if you would like, see here for more details.\nWhere do I store my files? So, I will be the first to admit that I have ran long jobs from my $HOME directory. This is bad. It will work but it is faster and better apparently to run your jobs in the $SCRATCH. It\u0026rsquo;ll be tedious at first but getting used to using simple commands like cp and \\verb!ls! will be really helpful. Make sure to save all of your results rather than just plotting graphs at the end, you never know when you might want to alter figures and need the original data again. I would recommend just saving your data and maybe copying it back to your PC to visualise the results. See my guide on how to layout and use a python package for a small research project for more detailed recommendations on how to handle results and plotting for Python specifically.\nJobscripts The thing you run is the jobscript using the command\nsbatch \u0026lt;name of jobscript\u0026gt;.slm\r Below I\u0026rsquo;ve put in an example jobscript that has been adapted from the one given in the scientific computing module. Make sure you are in the directory of the jobscript when you call it and that the program you want to run is in the same folder or that you have specified where it is in the jobscript.\n#!/bin/bash # # Specify the queue\r#SBATCH\r# Choose name of job (name of executable) #SBATCH --job-name = \u0026lt;name of script\u0026gt;.py # Choose the number of nodes \u0026amp; processors per node: #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1 # # Choose the time your code will need at most:\r#SBATCH --time=05:00:00 # Add any module which need to be loaded here module load python3\recho Running on host `hostname`\recho \u0026quot;Starting job...\u0026quot;\r# Run the python script $SLUTM_JOB_NAME # If your script is in MATLAB obviously this needs to be changed\rpython3 $SLURM_JOB_NAME\r The important bits to check are the job name and the time. For ease I have just made the job name the same as the name of the script you want to run. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain later what the job name is actually used for. Balena allows you free, unlimited usage for jobs which are under 6 hours long so make sure you know approximately how long it will take and change the time given accordingly. Nothing will happen if you overestimate how long you need but it could be helpful for other users to know when their jobs will start if balena is busy and puts your job in ahead of theirs.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using MATLAB and the paralellisation package thing that I know nothing about, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to change the number of tasks per node to the maximum of 16 I imagine. Otherwise, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve done clever things with the MPI4pi or multiprocessing packages in python (which I would highly recommend you learn about if you need to run long programs a lot because this could increase your speed by 16 times or more) then you will probably just be using the one processor and so don\u0026rsquo;t need to change anything.\nChecking Jobs You will get an output file with the extension .out telling you everything that happens in the job that would normally printed to the screen if you ran it from a terminal.\nTo check your progress or see if the job has started you can find your jobs by typing\nsqueue -u user123\r ","date":1608543892,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608543892,"objectID":"bfaf2f2779508d6f725d21d9fa6d0ce1","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/post/balenaguide/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T09:44:52Z","relpermalink":"/post/balenaguide/","section":"post","summary":"This informal guide is for people new to using Balena and effectively want to take code they have written to run on their laptop in something like Python or MATLAB and now run it on Balena.","tags":["Scientific Computing","how-to guide"],"title":"A Beginners Guide to using Balena","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jeremy Worsfold"],"categories":["Scientific Computing"],"content":"How to use Python for scientific research Maintaining a personal Python package for scientific research  Our project should  Save data Separate plotting from time-consuming code Have good documentation Be Distributable   Why Python?

My goal for the session will be to give a tour of what kind of maths happens at its core. The basic objects are probability spaces and random variables, which are built on the language of measure theory. My take, however, is that measure theory is just half of the story -- you do not want to do probability on *any* space ... it must be on a space as nice as R. In other words, I would say that the core of probability is about *Probability Measures on Metric Spaces*. This is the title of a book by K R Parthasarathy.\nSo, the tour centres around this book. I will take some time to explain how one should go from A-Level probability and statistics + mathematical analysis (point set topology, metric spaces) to the starting point of this book. Once we have reached the start of the book, I will give a whirlwind tour on the most important ideas in it. The second part is intended to be a touch-and-go, as a cultural appreciation of the language and the results that one can expect in this field.

For example in ecosystems, we know that the extinction of a prey species can lead to a mass extinction of predator species that feed on prey to sustain themselves, and genetic diversity helps organisms adapting to changing environments and rapidly evolving diseases. But is there a way to quantify stability with maths?\nWhen mathematicians speak about the stability of ecosystems, they usually refer to the asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point, characterised by the eigenvalues of a species interaction matrix. In reality, however, these interaction coefficients are difficult - if not impossible - to measure. Therefore in 1972, Robert M. May introduced a community matrix model, where coefficients are sampled from a random distribution, and derived a stability criterion based on the distribution of the eigenvalues using random matrix theory. For nearly 50 years, this model has been improved and applied in theoretical ecology.","tags":["Ecology","complex systems"],"title":"Will a Large Complex System be Stable?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Matt Turner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605780900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605780900,"objectID":"a58742def960e898f19a55da9571b684","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/mattturner/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/mattturner/","section":"pss","summary":"It is rare that blowing something up solves a problem - but when it comes to objects with singularities, it turns out to be a good approach!
