A set $Y \\subset X$ is positively invariant if $x(0) \\in Y$ implies that $x(t) \\in Y$ for all $t \\in T$ with $t \u0026gt; 0$. (It is negatively invariant if the same is true for all $t \\in T$ with $t \u0026lt; 0$.)\nStability  Steady state: $x^*$, is where $f(x^*)=0$ Stable: for any $\\epsilon \u0026gt; 0$ there exists $\\delta \u0026gt; 0$ such that $|x(t) − x^*| \u0026lt; \\epsilon$ for all positive $t \\in T$ whenever $|x_0 − x^*| \u0026lt; \\delta$, and unstable otherwise. Asymptotically stable: if it is stable and there exists $\\delta \u0026gt; 0$ such that $|x− x^*| \\rightarrow 0$ as $t → \\infty$ whenever $|x_0 − x^*| \u0026lt; \\delta$. stable: start close, stay close. asym. stable: start close, converge to steady state.  Time dependent solution If $\\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x)$ and $f(x_0)\\neq0$, then $$ t = \\int_{x_0}^{x(t)}\\frac{ds}{f(s)} $$\n If $x(t)$ is not a steady state, $x^*$,then it either tends to a steady state or it tends to $\\pm\\infty$ If the model system is well-posed, then $x(t)$ must either be a steady state solution, $x^*$, or strictly monotonic.   Problem sheet 1 The main point of most of this module is to test your abilities to turn a problem often in the form of a paragraph into a mathematical model which you then solve and then learn something about the behaviour of the system or whatever from the solution. Because of this I will not just give you the start of the problem because that is often half of the difficulty in the question. Learning how to do this quickly and effectively now will help you a lot later down the road, so do keep trying even if you feel stuck.\nQuestion 1  One question you might ask about this problem is why does the dead plant matter have a decreasing number of radioactive carbon atoms but the carbon in the atmosphere does not? This is a bit of a side note but essentially Carbon-14 is produced when particles in the upper atmosphere and troposphere collide with cosmic particles and all sorts of interesting physics happens. These interactions sometimes produce neutrons which can then collide with the abundand nitrogen in the air to make Carbon-14 with the following interaction:\n147N + n → 146C + p\n  Anyway the point is that once the plant dies it is separated from this system of radioactive carbon being created and decaying so we just have the decay. From the lectures we saw that the general radioactive decay equation is $$\\dot{x}(t) = -\\lambda x(t)$$ which has the solution $$x(t) = x(0)e^{-\\lambda t} $$. The key is to figure out what this rate of decay $\\lambda$ is in terms of the half-life which we are given. The half-life is the time, $T_{1/2}$ for the amount of 14C to half so we can write that $$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp\\left[-\\lambda T_{1/2}\\right]$$ which rearranges to give $$ \\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}$$. From here, all we need to do is recognise that we want to find the time $T$ where the activity is $0.97$ and we know that initially the activity was $6.68$ so we have $$ 0.97 = 6.68 e^{-\\lambda T}$$. With some more rearranging we get the solution $$ T = \\frac{T_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)}\\ln\\left(6.68/0.97\\right) \\approx 1.5951 \\times 10^4 \\text{ years}$$\n Wondered why the radioactive decay is what it is? It may make intuitive sense to you or it may not. Either way a nice way to think about it is that the probability of a single atom decaying in time $t$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $\\lambda$. Over a period of time $t$ the probability that is has not decayed is $1-F(t)=1-e^{-\\lambda t}$, where $F(t)$ is the cumulative distribution. If all of the atoms can be treated as independent (and as long as the number of particles is large) then the expected number of particles left by time t is $\\langle N\\rangle = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$.\nOr we could say that rate of one atom decaying is $\\lambda$ so the rate of any of the $N$ particles decaying is $N\\lambda$ so this gives us an instantaneous rate of change of the system so $dN=-N\\lambda dt$.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure given some more thought, one of you could make this a bit more rigourous.\n  Question 2 Should be relatively straight forward\nQuestion 3  a) What do the two terms on the RHS mean physically? b) What does the steady state distribution mean for the ODE? c) This one is just a following through the maths so I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that up to you.  Question 4 This question is pretty straight forwards in terms of setting up the problem. All we need to do is solve the ODE in the case that $c_i=c_a=\\text{ constant}$ and substitute in the initial condition that the concentration starts at some value $c_0=c(0)$ so we can substitute this condition in for any constants of integration. Then we do the same for the second case.\nThe trick in part b is to notice that we can rewrite the ODE as $$ \\begin{aligned} c_b'(t) \u0026amp; = \\phi \\left( c_a \\left( \\lambda + \\phi \\alpha (1-\\lambda) t \\right)- c_b(t)\\right) \\\\\\\nc_b'(t) + \\phi c_b(t) \u0026amp; = \\phi\\left(c_a\\left(\\lambda+\\phi\\alpha(1-\\lambda)t\\right)\\right) \\\\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left\\{c_b(t)e^{\\phi t}\\right\\} \u0026amp; = e^{\\phi t}\\phi\\left(c_a\\left(\\lambda+\\phi\\alpha(1-\\lambda)t\\right)\\right) \\end{aligned} $$ where we\u0026rsquo;ve used an integrating factor. From here we can integrate both sides and use integration by parts for the $t\\exp[\\phi t]$ term.\n","date":1612869300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612869300,"objectID":"5b6d59068d0dbac465760c94d74cd3dd","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/tutoring/week2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutoring/week2/","section":"tutoring","summary":"Definitions and First order ODEs","tags":["odes"],"title":"Week 2: 09/02/21","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Seb Scott"],"categories":["Inverse Problems"],"content":"By the end of this PSS talk you should:\n Understand how inverse problems may arise and why they can be finicky to deal with Feel happy with the idea of Tikhonov regularisation Get the gist of how iterative Krylov methods, such as LSQR and FLSQR, work Be able to name my dogs  ","date":1610964900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610964900,"objectID":"6e4256442c9f4cba969c533ad0498a24","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/sebscott/","publishdate":"2021-01-18T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/sebscott/","section":"pss","summary":"Solving inverse problems in imaging can be very challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and high dimensionality.

This is by no means exhaustive and there is much more information on the wiki page. In fact, much of the information on Balena here is just condensed from that website. The rest of this guide is general tips on how to transfer files and navigate the environment.\nLogging onto Balena Purely from a terminal If you are on campus you can skip the first step and ssh directly into balena. Otherwise open a terminal and type\nssh user123@linux.bath.ac.uk\r This opens up a link to the uni server (ssh stands for secure shell). Put in your password and then do the same again but change linux to balena:\nssh user123@balena.bath.ac.uk\r Great, you are now in your personal home directory on balena.\nKitty Using the image below taken from the wiki page should be sufficient in explaining how to login using Kitty.\nTransferring data or files Since you are running your code on balena, you will at some point have to move around data using a terminal so I would recommend doing this for all the steps. The added benefit of this is that your commands are stored so you can always just reuse your previous commands using the up arrows if you can\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly what a command should be.\nTo move files between your PC and balena you will sadly have to go through your uni drive unless you are on campus.\nFrom H drive to balena You can simply copy files across using linux cp commands and the fact that your H drive is called $BUCSHOME on balena. For example, run the command\ncp -r folder/with/data $BUCSHOME/destination/folder\r to copy a folder with data from balena to your H drive.\nFrom local PC to H drive You can transfer data to and from University personal drive from your PC by using scp which stands for secure copy and essentially opens up a ssh portal and then closes it again once the files are transferred.\nSending files Type one of these from within a terminal/kitty/putty on your PC:\nscp path/to/directory/f.txt user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/directory/\rscp -r path/to/directory/ user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/directory/\r The first will transfer the file file.txt whereas the second will transfer the whole directory.\nRetrieving files This is the same as above but with the directories reversed in order, for example:\nscp user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/remote/directory/file.txt path/to/local/directory/\r Alternatively if you want, you can use something more familiar which is visual. For linux this would be mounting your Uni drive to your PC using a command called sshfs. For Windows you can download an application called WinSCP which looks like it hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed since 2005 and basically hasn\u0026rsquo;t but it\u0026rsquo;s neat and very useful if that\u0026rsquo;s your thing. A quick google of either of these should give you the information you need. Finally you can use a browser to do this instead if you would like, see here for more details.\nWhere do I store my files? So, I will be the first to admit that I have ran long jobs from my $HOME directory. This is bad. It will work but it is faster and better apparently to run your jobs in the $SCRATCH. It\u0026rsquo;ll be tedious at first but getting used to using simple commands like cp and \\verb!ls! will be really helpful. Make sure to save all of your results rather than just plotting graphs at the end, you never know when you might want to alter figures and need the original data again. I would recommend just saving your data and maybe copying it back to your PC to visualise the results. See my guide on how to layout and use a python package for a small research project for more detailed recommendations on how to handle results and plotting for Python specifically.\nJobscripts The thing you run is the jobscript using the command\nsbatch \u0026lt;name of jobscript\u0026gt;.slm\r Below I\u0026rsquo;ve put in an example jobscript that has been adapted from the one given in the scientific computing module. Make sure you are in the directory of the jobscript when you call it and that the program you want to run is in the same folder or that you have specified where it is in the jobscript.\n#!/bin/bash # # Specify the queue\r#SBATCH\r# Choose name of job (name of executable) #SBATCH --job-name = \u0026lt;name of script\u0026gt;.py # Choose the number of nodes \u0026amp; processors per node: #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1 # # Choose the time your code will need at most:\r#SBATCH --time=05:00:00 # Add any module which need to be loaded here module load python3\recho Running on host `hostname`\recho \u0026quot;Starting job...\u0026quot;\r# Run the python script $SLUTM_JOB_NAME # If your script is in MATLAB obviously this needs to be changed\rpython3 $SLURM_JOB_NAME\r The important bits to check are the job name and the time. For ease I have just made the job name the same as the name of the script you want to run. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain later what the job name is actually used for. Balena allows you free, unlimited usage for jobs which are under 6 hours long so make sure you know approximately how long it will take and change the time given accordingly. Nothing will happen if you overestimate how long you need but it could be helpful for other users to know when their jobs will start if balena is busy and puts your job in ahead of theirs.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using MATLAB and the paralellisation package thing that I know nothing about, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to change the number of tasks per node to the maximum of 16 I imagine. Otherwise, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve done clever things with the MPI4pi or multiprocessing packages in python (which I would highly recommend you learn about if you need to run long programs a lot because this could increase your speed by 16 times or more) then you will probably just be using the one processor and so don\u0026rsquo;t need to change anything.\nChecking Jobs You will get an output file with the extension .out telling you everything that happens in the job that would normally printed to the screen if you ran it from a terminal.\nTo check your progress or see if the job has started you can find your jobs by typing\nsqueue -u user123\r ","date":1608543892,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608543892,"objectID":"bfaf2f2779508d6f725d21d9fa6d0ce1","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/post/balenaguide/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T09:44:52Z","relpermalink":"/post/balenaguide/","section":"post","summary":"This informal guide is for people new to using Balena and effectively want to take code they have written to run on their laptop in something like Python or MATLAB and now run it on Balena.","tags":["Scientific Computing","how-to guide"],"title":"A Beginners Guide to using Balena","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jeremy Worsfold"],"categories":["Scientific Computing"],"content":"How to use Python for scientific research Maintaining a personal Python package for scientific research  Our project should  Save data Separate plotting from time-consuming code Have good documentation Be Distributable   Why Python?

For example in ecosystems, we know that the extinction of a prey species can lead to a mass extinction of predator species that feed on prey to sustain themselves, and genetic diversity helps organisms adapting to changing environments and rapidly evolving diseases. But is there a way to quantify stability with maths?\nWhen mathematicians speak about the stability of ecosystems, they usually refer to the asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point, characterised by the eigenvalues of a species interaction matrix. In reality, however, these interaction coefficients are difficult - if not impossible - to measure. Therefore in 1972, Robert M. May introduced a community matrix model, where coefficients are sampled from a random distribution, and derived a stability criterion based on the distribution of the eigenvalues using random matrix theory.

This measure is the one that we all use each day without knowing it - it tells us that the area of a circle is πr2, and justifies the existence of rulers. At the end of this talk everyone will (hopefully) leave with an understanding of how measure theory permeates into other areas of mathematics, and an introductory understanding to the theory as a whole.","tags":["measure theory"],"title":"What is Measure Theory, and How does it Affect Me?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jeremy Worsfold"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603966500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603966500,"objectID":"d8957e38a5c62dfc557e4b7c0eb8c23c","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/jeremy/","publishdate":"2020-10-29T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/jeremy/","section":"pss","summary":"How tech giants are force-feeding us annoyingly useful adverts","tags":["reinforcement learning","recommender systems"],"title":"Multi-armed bandits","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Cameron Smith"],"categories":["Mathematical Biology"],"content":"","date":1603361700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603361700,"objectID":"062558c0c2d85ac6148437e1a9e5d562","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/cameron/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/cameron/","section":"pss","summary":"In this somewhat maths deficient PSS talk, I plan to convince you that hybrid models are very useful for simulating multi-scale systems. And if not, well at least there is (virtual) cake afterwards! Join me for a (mostly pictorial) journey through several different hybrid approaches to simulate reaction-diffusion systems; an important group of models for explaining, predicting and answering the big questions in biology such as: Why do some mice have belly spots? How can we stop the next big pandemic from destroying us all? (If only we had paid attention back then!) Why can’t a leopard change its spots (into stripes at the very least)?\nWe will then move onwards to some of my own work, creating new models which add in extra biological realism or simply fill a gap in the market. Health warning: may contain traces of maths, a pinch of biology and some weird images. Fun cannot be guaranteed.","tags":["Mathematical Biology"],"title":"Hybrid methods: innovative or a waste of time?

One of the simplest and perhaps most natural examples is curve shortening flow, the topic I did my master's dissertation on, where essentially a curve *moves inwards with speed proportional to its bendiness.*\nIn this talk we will give an introduction to curve shortening flow and look at some of the (surprising?) ways in which it behaves, starting in the plane before moving onto surfaces. We will then briefly touch on mean curvature flow, a generalisation of curve shortening flow to higher dimensions, and see some of the applications of curve shortening flow in both pure maths and the real world.","tags":["differential geometry","geometry"],"title":"Curve Shortening Flow","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Piotr Morawiecki"],"categories":null,"content":"There will be some equations and overviews of proofs, but it won\u0026rsquo;t be super technical, and there\u0026rsquo;ll also be nice pictures and diagrams so it should be possible to follow the talk without any knowledge of differential geometry at all!\n","date":1602152100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602152100,"objectID":"7dea2106a9fe38356d84a1f144bf216d","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/piotr/","publishdate":"2020-10-08T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/piotr/","section":"pss","summary":"Why running science projects in schools is fun?","tags":null,"title":"From alco-rockets and neural networks in a can to international political incidents","type":"talk"}]
