My goal for the session will be to give a tour of what kind of maths happens at its core.

In other words, I would say that the core of probability is about \u0026ldquo;Probability Measures on Metric Spaces\u0026rdquo;. This is the title of a book by K R Parthasarathy.\nSo, the tour centres around this book. I will take some time to explain how one should go from A-Level probability and statistics + mathematical analysis (point set topology, metric spaces) to the starting point of this book. Once we have reached the start of the book, I will give a whirlwind tour on the most important ideas in it. The second part is intended to be a touch-and-go, as a cultural appreciation of the language and the results that one can expect in this field. Come by and have fun with probability!\n","date":1606990500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606990500,"objectID":"e78c15154b7b241aff9a9993a296ca33","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/yisheng/","publishdate":"2020-12-03T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/yisheng/","section":"pss","summary":"Probability is a big subject.

This is just a test. It\u0026rsquo;s really slow. The compressed html is 73MB for LSOA London and 123MB for MSOA e0 in England. This is with super-generalised shapefiles too, never mind if we want to get things at 20m resolution for LSOAs. Other annoying things:\n kepler.gl is slow MSOA England level takes even longer to load It is slow It flashes between frames sometimes because it uses a rolling window to animate rather than a point for each year The year comes up with minutes and seconds and milliseconds and picoseconds The file sizes are too big to put on github without lfs  I probably need to find a more practical solution for the full result.\nHave a play.
