Therefore, when you give numerical answers, it\u0026rsquo;s important to give the units and probably also to how many significant figures.   Question 2 I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything in particular to highlight for this question.\nQuestion 3   b) The key point here is that we are told the concentration is at a steady state so $dV/dt = f(V) = 0$. We know $\\mu$ from the previous part of the question so we can sub in our values for $V,\\mu$ into $$ \\kappa=\\mu V $$\n  c) first solve for $I(t)$ then sub into $V(t)$ ode which can then be solved. Again, easiest in this case to use integrating factor. The written solutions go into a lot of detail by looking at $\\mu\u0026gt;\\delta$ and $\\mu\u0026lt;\\delta$ then $\\mu\\rightarrow\\delta$ to show that $V$ is always positive. The key things to look at when we want to sketch the solution and then comment on it are:\n Is $V$ always positive? (as the solutions show) What does it look like near $t\\approx0$? ($dV/dt\u0026gt;0$ so is increasing) What does it look like as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$? ($V\\rightarrow 0$) Are there any turning points?  We can infer that there is a turning point purely from the fact that $V$ starts off increasing from $0$ but will eventually return to $0$ so there must be a turning point which we can find explicity if needed. This gives us enough information to draw a sketch of the solution though which can be seen below for some arbitrary choice of $\\delta,\\mu$.\n    (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./a1q3.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-821674593', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();   Outline of lecture content Geometric Method This picture should sum up the takeaways from this section in the notes. If $f(x)\u0026gt;0$ then $x$ by definition is increasing and so our system will move towards the right. Conversely if $f(x)\u0026lt;0$ then $x$ decreases and so we draw a left arrow instead. This then tells us the stability of our steady states located at $f(x)=0$. If the arrows point inwards then it\u0026rsquo;s stable and we can show this with a filled circle, if they point outwards then it\u0026rsquo;s unstable and we denote this with a hollow circle.\n What happens if there is a turning point at $f(x)=0$? Is the steady state stable or unstable?   Linear Stability Analysis There isn\u0026rsquo;t much to add here beyond what the lecture notes have.\nBifurcations Now we have non-linear systems with some parameter $\\mu$ and we want to know how the system behaves for different values of this parameter. We can still use the same techniques as before but now we get a rich understanding of a more general problem.\n Firstly, we can find the steady states, $x^*$, such that $f(x^*;\\mu)=0$. This will give us some solutions for $x^*$ in terms of our parameter $\\mu$. Next we need to make sure we know for what values of $\\mu$, these solutions exist. When there is a range of values for which some solutions exist but do not outside this range, we get a bifurcation. We can then go ahead and plot these solutions in the allowed range in a plot of $x$ vs $\\mu$. Finally, to determine the stability of these solutions, we use the linear stability method from before. If a solution is stable then $$ \\frac{dx}{dt}|_{x^*}\u0026lt;0 $$ and the opposite is true for unstable solutions. If we have equality then the steady state is non-hyperbolic and we have to look at the higher derivaties. We then draw the unstable solutions with dashed lines and the stable ones with filled in lines  In the notes which are available at the top of this page, I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn a few examples of some bifurcations we might see. Some are a bit beyond what will be studied in the course but this gives an idea of the standard types of sketches we expect to see. Below is one such example.\n Notice that in all cases, in the $x$-direction the solutions for $x^*$ will alternate between being stable and unstable. If this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case then this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make sense as arrows would be pointing in contradicting directions and the only resolution to this would be for another steady state to exist of the opposite type in between these solutions. Specifically, $f(x)$ will have changed sign at some point between the solutions and so $f(x)=0$ at some point.    Problem sheet A2 Question 1 This question does not really have anything conceptually new. The steps are just\n Use the substitution specified Use an integrating factor of $\\exp(\\int P(t) dt)$ Obtain a solution for $y$ in terms of general $P(t),Q(t)$. Substitute in $P(t)=-r$, $Q(t)=-r/k$ and $n=2$. The rest is rearranging for $x(t)$ and putting in an initial condition of $x(0)=x_0$. Full working can be found in the solutions on moodle.  Question 3 Following the steps I outlined before we first find that $$ x_{\\pm}^* = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4\\mu}\\right) $$ Remember we need to check the range in which these solutions are valid. $$\\Rightarrow 4\\mu\\leq 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\mu\\leq\\frac{1}{4}$$ Also we\u0026rsquo;re working with a population and a harvesting rate so $x\u0026gt;0,\\mu\u0026gt;0$.\nNext we find the stability of these steady states: $$ \\frac{df}{dx} = 1 - 2x, \\quad \\Rightarrow \\frac{dx}{dt}|_ {x^*_{\\pm}} = \\mp\\sqrt{1-4\\mu} $$ so $x_{+}^*$ is stable and $x_{-}^*$ is unstable.\nWe can also check what happens when $\\mu\\geq1/4$. There is a turning point at $x=1/2$, and we know it\u0026rsquo;s maximum since $$ \\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = -2 $$ Now, $$f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)= \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}-\\mu=\\frac{1}{4}-\\mu\u0026lt;0$$. Therefore $f(x;\\mu)\u0026lt;0$ for $\\mu\u0026gt;1/4$ and thus the population goes to $0$.\nBelow I\u0026rsquo;ve put a heatmap of $f(x;\\mu)$, the boundary where it switches from light red to light blue gives us the steady state solutions and we can determine the stability too. Red means $f(x;\\mu)\u0026lt;0$ so it\u0026rsquo;s like an arrow pointing down while blue is like an arrow pointing up.\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./bifn.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-791458362', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  ","date":1645660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645660800,"objectID":"6fd90e98dbcf1e49f96e75a7dfdcacb4","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/tutoring/week3/","publishdate":"2022-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutoring/week3/","section":"tutoring","summary":"Nonlinear 1D Systems","tags":["odes"],"title":"Week 3: 16/02/21","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yyanis Johnson-Llambias"],"categories":["epidemiology","science in politics"],"content":"","date":1621505700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621505700,"objectID":"92415c108dc368b5c4dcd448e5769325","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/yyanis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/yyanis/","section":"pss","summary":"I will talk about the work I have done over the past 3 months in the UK Government Office for Science, the department responsible for ensuring the UK Gov has access to the best and most up to date scientific advice during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

A set $Y \\subset X$ is positively invariant if $x(0) \\in Y$ implies that $x(t) \\in Y$ for all $t \\in T$ with $t \u0026gt; 0$.

Problem sheet 1 The main point of most of this module is to test your abilities to turn a problem often in the form of a paragraph into a mathematical model which you then solve and then learn something about the behaviour of the system or whatever from the solution. Because of this I will not just give you the start of the problem because that is often half of the difficulty in the question. Learning how to do this quickly and effectively now will help you a lot later down the road, so do keep trying even if you feel stuck.\nQuestion 1  One question you might ask about this problem is why does the dead plant matter have a decreasing number of radioactive carbon atoms but the carbon in the atmosphere does not? This is a bit of a side note but essentially Carbon-14 is produced when particles in the upper atmosphere and troposphere collide with cosmic particles and all sorts of interesting physics happens. These interactions sometimes produce neutrons which can then collide with the abundand nitrogen in the air to make Carbon-14 with the following interaction:\n147N + n → 146C + p\n  Anyway the point is that once the plant dies it is separated from this system of radioactive carbon being created and decaying so we just have the decay. From the lectures we saw that the general radioactive decay equation is $$\\dot{x}(t) = -\\lambda x(t)$$ which has the solution $$x(t) = x(0)e^{-\\lambda t} $$. The key is to figure out what this rate of decay $\\lambda$ is in terms of the half-life which we are given. The half-life is the time, $T_{1/2}$ for the amount of 14C to half so we can write that $$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp\\left[-\\lambda T_{1/2}\\right]$$ which rearranges to give $$ \\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}$$. From here, all we need to do is recognise that we want to find the time $T$ where the activity is $0.97$ and we know that initially the activity was $6.68$ so we have $$ 0.97 = 6.68 e^{-\\lambda T}$$. With some more rearranging we get the solution $$ T = \\frac{T_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)}\\ln\\left(6.68/0.97\\right) \\approx 1.5951 \\times 10^4 \\text{ years}$$\n Wondered why the radioactive decay is what it is? It may make intuitive sense to you or it may not. Either way a nice way to think about it is that the probability of a single atom decaying in time $t$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $\\lambda$. Over a period of time $t$ the probability that is has not decayed is $1-F(t)=1-e^{-\\lambda t}$, where $F(t)$ is the cumulative distribution. If all of the atoms can be treated as independent (and as long as the number of particles is large) then the expected number of particles left by time t is $\\langle N\\rangle = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$.\nOr we could say that rate of one atom decaying is $\\lambda$ so the rate of any of the $N$ particles decaying is $N\\lambda$ so this gives us an instantaneous rate of change of the system so $dN=-N\\lambda dt$.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure given some more thought, one of you could make this a bit more rigourous.\n  Question 2 Should be relatively straight forward\nQuestion 3  a) What do the two terms on the RHS mean physically? b) What does the steady state distribution mean for the ODE? c) This one is just a following through the maths so I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that up to you.  Question 4 This question is pretty straight forwards in terms of setting up the problem. All we need to do is solve the ODE in the case that $c_i=c_a=\\text{ constant}$ and substitute in the initial condition that the concentration starts at some value $c_0=c(0)$ so we can substitute this condition in for any constants of integration. Then we do the same for the second case.\nThe trick in part b is to notice that we can rewrite the ODE as $$ \\begin{aligned} c_b'(t) \u0026amp; = \\phi \\left( c_a \\left( \\lambda + \\phi \\alpha (1-\\lambda) t \\right)- c_b(t)\\right) \\\\\\\nc_b'(t) + \\phi c_b(t) \u0026amp; = \\phi\\left(c_a\\left(\\lambda+\\phi\\alpha(1-\\lambda)t\\right)\\right) \\\\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left\\{c_b(t)e^{\\phi t}\\right\\} \u0026amp; = e^{\\phi t}\\phi\\left(c_a\\left(\\lambda+\\phi\\alpha(1-\\lambda)t\\right)\\right) \\end{aligned} $$ where we\u0026rsquo;ve used an integrating factor. From here we can integrate both sides and use integration by parts for the $t\\exp[\\phi t]$ term.\n","date":1612869300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612869300,"objectID":"5b6d59068d0dbac465760c94d74cd3dd","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/tutoring/week2/","publishdate":"2022-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutoring/week2/","section":"tutoring","summary":"Definitions and First order ODEs","tags":["odes"],"title":"Week 2: 09/02/21","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Tom Finn"],"categories":["Probability Theory"],"content":"","date":1612433700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612433700,"objectID":"42b38e289649c94dc0e5e7bdb6674e3e","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/tomfinn/","publishdate":"2021-02-04T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/tomfinn/","section":"pss","summary":"Random growth processes are paradigmatic in probability theory and describe phenomena in many contexts, such as cancer growth, rumour propagation and population dynamics.

We will discuss known results for DLA and its variations, culminating in an astonishing recent result by Elboim, Nam, and Sly that describes critical behaviour for the model in dimension one, the only dimension that is known to observe a phase transition.

This is by no means exhaustive and there is much more information on the wiki page. In fact, much of the information on Balena here is just condensed from that website. The rest of this guide is general tips on how to transfer files and navigate the environment.\nLogging onto Balena Purely from a terminal If you are on campus you can skip the first step and ssh directly into balena. Otherwise open a terminal and type\nssh user123@linux.bath.ac.uk\r This opens up a link to the uni server (ssh stands for secure shell). Put in your password and then do the same again but change linux to balena:\nssh user123@balena.bath.ac.uk\r Great, you are now in your personal home directory on balena.\nKitty Using the image below taken from the wiki page should be sufficient in explaining how to login using Kitty.\nTransferring data or files Since you are running your code on balena, you will at some point have to move around data using a terminal so I would recommend doing this for all the steps. The added benefit of this is that your commands are stored so you can always just reuse your previous commands using the up arrows if you can\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly what a command should be.\nTo move files between your PC and balena you will sadly have to go through your uni drive unless you are on campus.\nFrom H drive to balena You can simply copy files across using linux cp commands and the fact that your H drive is called $BUCSHOME on balena. For example, run the command\ncp -r folder/with/data $BUCSHOME/destination/folder\r to copy a folder with data from balena to your H drive.\nFrom local PC to H drive You can transfer data to and from University personal drive from your PC by using scp which stands for secure copy and essentially opens up a ssh portal and then closes it again once the files are transferred.\nSending files Type one of these from within a terminal/kitty/putty on your PC:\nscp path/to/directory/f.txt user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/directory/\rscp -r path/to/directory/ user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/directory/\r The first will transfer the file file.txt whereas the second will transfer the whole directory.\nRetrieving files This is the same as above but with the directories reversed in order, for example:\nscp user123@linux.bath.ac.uk:path/to/remote/directory/file.txt path/to/local/directory/\r Alternatively if you want, you can use something more familiar which is visual. For linux this would be mounting your Uni drive to your PC using a command called sshfs. For Windows you can download an application called WinSCP which looks like it hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed since 2005 and basically hasn\u0026rsquo;t but it\u0026rsquo;s neat and very useful if that\u0026rsquo;s your thing. A quick google of either of these should give you the information you need. Finally you can use a browser to do this instead if you would like, see here for more details.\nWhere do I store my files? So, I will be the first to admit that I have ran long jobs from my $HOME directory. This is bad. It will work but it is faster and better apparently to run your jobs in the $SCRATCH. It\u0026rsquo;ll be tedious at first but getting used to using simple commands like cp and \\verb!ls! will be really helpful. Make sure to save all of your results rather than just plotting graphs at the end, you never know when you might want to alter figures and need the original data again. I would recommend just saving your data and maybe copying it back to your PC to visualise the results. See my guide on how to layout and use a python package for a small research project for more detailed recommendations on how to handle results and plotting for Python specifically.\nJobscripts The thing you run is the jobscript using the command\nsbatch \u0026lt;name of jobscript\u0026gt;.slm\r Below I\u0026rsquo;ve put in an example jobscript that has been adapted from the one given in the scientific computing module. Make sure you are in the directory of the jobscript when you call it and that the program you want to run is in the same folder or that you have specified where it is in the jobscript.\n#!/bin/bash # # Specify the queue\r#SBATCH\r# Choose name of job (name of executable) #SBATCH --job-name = \u0026lt;name of script\u0026gt;.py # Choose the number of nodes \u0026amp; processors per node: #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1 # # Choose the time your code will need at most:\r#SBATCH --time=05:00:00 # Add any module which need to be loaded here module load python3\recho Running on host `hostname`\recho \u0026quot;Starting job...\u0026quot;\r# Run the python script $SLUTM_JOB_NAME # If your script is in MATLAB obviously this needs to be changed\rpython3 $SLURM_JOB_NAME\r The important bits to check are the job name and the time. For ease I have just made the job name the same as the name of the script you want to run. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain later what the job name is actually used for. Balena allows you free, unlimited usage for jobs which are under 6 hours long so make sure you know approximately how long it will take and change the time given accordingly. Nothing will happen if you overestimate how long you need but it could be helpful for other users to know when their jobs will start if balena is busy and puts your job in ahead of theirs.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using MATLAB and the paralellisation package thing that I know nothing about, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to change the number of tasks per node to the maximum of 16 I imagine. Otherwise, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve done clever things with the MPI4pi or multiprocessing packages in python (which I would highly recommend you learn about if you need to run long programs a lot because this could increase your speed by 16 times or more) then you will probably just be using the one processor and so don\u0026rsquo;t need to change anything.\nChecking Jobs You will get an output file with the extension .out telling you everything that happens in the job that would normally printed to the screen if you ran it from a terminal.\nTo check your progress or see if the job has started you can find your jobs by typing\nsqueue -u user123\r ","date":1608543892,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608543892,"objectID":"bfaf2f2779508d6f725d21d9fa6d0ce1","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/post/balenaguide/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T09:44:52Z","relpermalink":"/post/balenaguide/","section":"post","summary":"This informal guide is for people new to using Balena and effectively want to take code they have written to run on their laptop in something like Python or MATLAB and now run it on Balena.","tags":["Scientific Computing","how-to guide"],"title":"A Beginners Guide to using Balena","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jeremy Worsfold"],"categories":["Scientific Computing"],"content":"How to use Python for scientific research Maintaining a personal Python package for scientific research  Our project should  Save data Separate plotting from time-consuming code Have good documentation Be Distributable   Why Python?

My goal for the session will be to give a tour of what kind of maths happens at its core. The basic objects are probability spaces and random variables, which are built on the language of measure theory. My take, however, is that measure theory is just half of the story -- you do not want to do probability on *any* space ... it must be on a space as nice as R. In other words, I would say that the core of probability is about *Probability Measures on Metric Spaces*. This is the title of a book by K R Parthasarathy.\nSo, the tour centres around this book. I will take some time to explain how one should go from A-Level probability and statistics + mathematical analysis (point set topology, metric spaces) to the starting point of this book. Once we have reached the start of the book, I will give a whirlwind tour on the most important ideas in it. The second part is intended to be a touch-and-go, as a cultural appreciation of the language and the results that one can expect in this field.

For example in ecosystems, we know that the extinction of a prey species can lead to a mass extinction of predator species that feed on prey to sustain themselves, and genetic diversity helps organisms adapting to changing environments and rapidly evolving diseases. But is there a way to quantify stability with maths?\nWhen mathematicians speak about the stability of ecosystems, they usually refer to the asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point, characterised by the eigenvalues of a species interaction matrix. In reality, however, these interaction coefficients are difficult - if not impossible - to measure. Therefore in 1972, Robert M. May introduced a community matrix model, where coefficients are sampled from a random distribution, and derived a stability criterion based on the distribution of the eigenvalues using random matrix theory. For nearly 50 years, this model has been improved and applied in theoretical ecology.","tags":["Ecology","complex systems"],"title":"Will a Large Complex System be Stable?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Matt Turner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605780900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605780900,"objectID":"a58742def960e898f19a55da9571b684","permalink":"https://jeremyworsfold.github.io/pss/mattturner/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T10:15:00Z","relpermalink":"/pss/mattturner/","section":"pss","summary":"It is rare that blowing something up solves a problem - but when it comes to objects with singularities, it turns out to be a good approach!
